GUI design Guide:  
   Basically, there are two ways to display your widgets. The first one is the automatic layout management. For instance , you can use these classes to arrange your widgets, such as QGridLayout, QHBoxLayout, QVBoxLayout and etc. These class will do some calculations automatically, such as the position and the size of widgets. The second one is the manaul layout management. For instance, you need to provide a way to calculate the position and the size of widgets.
